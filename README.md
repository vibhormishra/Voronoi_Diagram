# Voronoi_Diagram
Implementation and analysis of Fortune's Algorithms for Voronoi Diagram. Implementation is done in Python.

Following python modules are required to run the script:

1) matplotlib
2) numpy


Script has a main() function which is mentioned at the end of the script. It runs the Voronoi diagram for 100 points taken at random using numpy. If you want to run it for specific number of points, change the value of "no_of_ver" variable in main().

To analyze performance on random inputs of points ranging from 10-100000, call PerformanceAnalyzer() funtion which is commented at the end of the script.
